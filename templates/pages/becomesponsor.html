<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
<p>PostgresOpen is a perfect opportunity for companies to reach
   out to users and developers of PostgreSQL, or to just "give back" to the
   community. Our sponsorship program covers a wide range of levels, from Supporter
   to Diamond. If you are interested in sponsoring the conference, please
   <b><a href="mailto:program2018@postgresopen.org">contact us!</a></b>
</p>
<p>
	The PostgresOpen SV 2018 prospectus is available <b><a href="{{media("files/prospectus_2018.pdf")}}">here!</a></b>
</p>
<p>
        PostgresOpen abides by the PostgreSQL Project <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/community/recognition/">Community Recognition guidelines</a>.
</p>
<p>
        When working with individual companies on sponsorship, PostgresOpen and <a href="https://postgresql.us/">PgUS</a> will only consider changes to
        the sponsorship contract which do not impact the material benefits provided to a given company or the cost of the sponsorship. The determination
        of what is considered a material benefit will be decided by the PostgresOpen operations committee and PgUS, as the signing authority. No changes
        to the benefits included in the prospectus will be accepted, nor will any sponsorship discounts be provided.
